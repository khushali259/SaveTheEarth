ANT MAN

Biography:
Former thief Scott Lang once stole an advanced size-altering suit in order to aid his ailing daughter, only to discover that the stolen tech belonged to the world-renowned Dr. Hank Pym. Seeing the heroic potential within him, Dr. Pym allowed Scott to continue using the suit, as well as the identity Pym once battled evil under. As the Astonishing Ant-Man, Scott now handles the jobs "too small" for any other Super Hero.
