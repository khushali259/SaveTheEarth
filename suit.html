	<h1>THE SUIT</h1>
	<hr>
	<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
	<p>A brilliant young scientist, Hank Pym worked in the U.S. Army and was eventually recruited by S.H.I.E.L.D. He eventually discovered a type of particle that could shorten the distance between an object's molecules, effectively reducing its size while maintaining its mass. Utilizing the newly-discovered particles, Pym developed a suit that could shrink a human being to the size of an ant, yet maintain his original strength and resilience.<br>Pym also developed the EMP Communication Device, a device that allowed him to telepathically communicate with ants. Through concentration, he could manipulate and control ants into doing what he wished. He found it difficult to control bullet ants but eventually learned to control them.</p>

	<h3>SECTIONS OF THE SUIT</h3>

	<p><img src="https://www.fjackets.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Antman-Helmet.jpg" align="right" height="25%" width="25%"><strong>HELMET</strong>: The helmet is made of thick metal and it protects the skull and brain of the user. Pym has stated that without the suit's kind of helmet, the chemical balance of the brain would be affected when shrinking. Pym emphasized the importance of wearing the helmet whenever activating the suit. A button on the side of the helmet retracts the mandible and front facial portion of the helmet to reveal the user's face. As for the upgraded suit, pushing the button will make the faceplate fall off, meaning that the newer helmet is no longer retractable, only removable. The third suit once again featured a retractable helmet, this time being capable of retracting entirely, fully exposing the user's head. It also has a radio-like system to communicate at a distance with an operator. The helmet was shown to be insulated against water and possibly able to filter out air, allowing the user to breathe underwater for an unknown length of time.</p>

One button shrinks the user and the other one makes them grow larger, whether it be to their regular size or gigantic size. Using the touch screen on one of the bracers will modify the suit's function to enlarge the size of the user to a gigantic scale instead of shrink.</p>

	<p><img src="https://www.screengeek.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ant-Man-Movie.jpg" align="right" height="35%" width="25%"><strong>GAUNTLETS</strong>: The upgraded suit contained a touch screen monitor on the forearms, that showed Pym Particle levels in the suit, his vital signs and allowed him to control how much of the particle he wanted to use. He could also use it to switch between the red and blue variants of the particles. He used this during Clash of the Avengers to switch to the blue variant and become "Giant Man".</p>

Manipulating this regulator is dangerous as it may shrink the user to a subatomic level and make it lose control of the suit. The belt also contains compartments for Pym Particles Disks. The regulator is somewhat compatible with Pym's enlarging disks technology, and in combination with them, it makes a user able to grow out of subatomic level and escape the Quantum Realm.</p>

The fabric isn't very dense as the taser darts shot by Jim Paxton were able to penetrate it and shock Scott. It doesn't protect against extreme temperatures either since Scott stated he felt cold while flying on an ant. Despite this, later versions of the suit were shown to be insulated against water, keeping the wearer fully dry inside of it should they be underwater.<br><br><br></p>
